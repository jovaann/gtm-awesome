# Script Awesome
WordPress plugin that allows inserting Javascript code for entire website or per page basis.

To use the plugin:

1. Install and activate the plugin in your WordPress dashboard.
2. Edit a page in the WordPress admin.
3. Scroll down to the "Script Awesome Code" section in the page editor to enter the JS code for <head> and <body>.
4. Publish or update the page.
5. JS code will be added to the selected page in the <head> and <body> sections.

You can repeat these steps for different pages to add different JS codes, and you can also see the code status in the page list.

To add JS code for entire site, click on Script Awesome from WordPress Dashboard. 

Note: If JS code is set on page basis, it will override global JS code. Otherwise, page will use global JS code.
